# Front end Store
When ever you try to access the store directly in a html element via the v-if statement it throughs an error
"The client-side rendered virtual DOM tree is not matching server-rendered content. This is likely caused
 by incorrect HTML markup, for example nesting block-level elements inside <p>, or missing <tbody>. 
Bailing hydration and performing full client-side render."

### But if the state's value is been given to the component data it renders without errors.
